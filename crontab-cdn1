# This is a readme file for cron on CDN-1
# Whichever server gets to be CDN 1 also gets more responsibility,
# namely for handling uploads and then boardcasting the changes to the other
# cdn servers. I do this with unison (https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/)
# CDN 1 needs to start a service which includes a file watch on the contributions
# directory


# "crontab -e" content:
@reboot /media/data/expressjs-cdn-crazyerics/autostart.sh # be sure this file is executable
