Hello!

As this CDN project has gotten bigger and more complex, the more worried I am that I'll forget all the moving
parts of the system! Let's keep this file updated with everything you need to know about how toget it all back up and running

cdn.crazyerics.com 
|
Synology reverse proxy
|
resolves to nginx docker container (192.168.1.2:73779 or something, make sure the port on the container is defined and not "auto")
|
Nginx container is a LOAD BALANCER, its config can be found in this project

CDN 1                   CDN 2

This CDN processes
contributions. 
Unison has a service
running to watch the
dir and boardcast
changes to the other
servers

- Each CDN will need cron installed. See the crontab files here for more notes and definitions

Unison folder watch works with a profile, executed "unison [profile]". This will barf the warning:
"Profile /root/.unison/[name].prf does not exist"
so create it first: 
"touch /root/.unison/cdn1.prf"
then nano in and paste the contents of the file here called "unison.prf"
