Hello!

As this CDN project has gotten bigger and more complex, the more worried I am that I'll forget all the moving
parts of the system! Let's keep this file updated with everything you need to know about how toget it all back up and running

cdn.crazyerics.com 
|
Synology reverse proxy
|
resolves to nginx docker container (192.168.1.2:73779 or some port, make sure th`e port on the container is defined and not "auto")
|
Nginx container is a LOAD BALANCER, its config can be found in this project
It forwards all sorts of traffic and limits the speed on certain routes

CDN 1                   CDN 2

This CDN processes
contributions using
unison.

- Each CDN will need cron installed. See the crontab files here for more notes and definitions

Unison sync works with a profile, executed "unison [profile]". Despite being exec in code, all traffic
for contributions will go to CDN1. An external process will be fired to sync the files on CDN1 to the
others. you can test it on CDN1 with "unison cdn1"
If you get:
create it first: 
"touch ./.unison/cdn-sync.prf"
then nano in and paste the contents of the file here called "unison.prf"
Note - I started with the goal to not have code trigger this and instead use a file watch process
I had trouble getting unison's fsmonitor to work and in the end decided I'd rather not have the
overhead of the watch anyway, triggering on demand is better for something unfrequently run :)
