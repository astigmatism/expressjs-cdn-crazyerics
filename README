Hello!

As this CDN project has gotten bigger and more complex, the more worried I am that I'll forget all the moving
parts of the system! Let's keep this file updated with everything you need to know about how toget it all back up and running

cdn.crazyerics.com 
|
Synology reverse proxy
|
resolves to nginx docker container (192.168.1.2:73779 or some port, make sure th`e port on the container is defined and not "auto")
|
Nginx container is a LOAD BALANCER, its config can be found in this project
It forwards all sorts of traffic and limits the speed on certain routes
|                       |
CDN 1                   CDN 2
|
This CDN processes
contributions using
unison.

- Each CDN will need cron installed. See the crontab files here for more notes and definitions

Unison sync works with a profile, executed "unison [profile]". Despite being exec in code, all traffic
for contributions will go to CDN1. An external process will be fired to sync the files on CDN1 to the
others. you can test it on CDN1 with "unison cdn1"
If you get:
create it first: 
"touch ./.unison/cdn-sync.prf"
then nano in and paste the contents of the file here called "unison.prf"
Note - I started with the goal to not have code trigger this and instead use a file watch process
I had trouble getting unison's fsmonitor to work and in the end decided I'd rather not have the
overhead of the watch anyway, triggering on demand is better for something unfrequently run :)

Setting up this application
---------------------------

Okay, so at this time (Sept 27, 2019) I have the CDN application running in a VM on an ESXi instance usng the Synology as a datastore through the iSCSI interface.
I used Ubuntu Server 16.04 (I original deplyed on this version despite it being a little older) and ensured that SSH Server was installed with the OS.

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

*change from dhcp to static
address 192.168.1.x
netmask 255.255.255.0
gatewat 192.168.1.1
dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1
*save and quit, restart server

sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
* this installs nodejs v10 and npm
sudo npm install pm2 -g
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/astigmatism/expressjs-cdn-crazyerics.git
*you'll likely need your github account cred for this
*clones into ./expressjs-cdn-crazyerics
cd ./expressjs-cdn-crazyerics
npm install
*everything should be ready except for the content which I do not submit to github, for that you'll have to copy it over from another cdn with scp
*on source computer, navigate to expressjs-cdn-crazyerics directory
scp -r ./media astigmatism@192.168.1.x:/home/astigmatism/expressjs-cdn-crazyerics/media
scp -r ./content astigmatism@192.168.1.x:/home/astigmatism/expressjs-cdn-crazyerics/content
scp -r ./public astigmatism@192.168.1.x:/home/astigmatism/expressjs-cdn-crazyerics/public
scp -r ./contributions astigmatism@192.168.1.x:/home/astigmatism/expressjs-cdn-crazyerics/contributions
scp -r ./processed astigmatism@192.168.1.x:/home/astigmatism/expressjs-cdn-crazyerics/processed
*the last one is optional. You can see your cdn at work generating new processed (resized) content if you want
*note the fully qualified path for the destination. you might need to change the /home/astigmatism/ to where ever the project lives
pm2 start pm2.config.js

Note this was all from memory (although I performed all these tasks) so modify the above list is something isn't right. I might rely on it for a long time :)
